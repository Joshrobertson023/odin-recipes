      <ul>
         <li>
            Microwave the Ramen until the noodles are firm and fully cooked. 
            Feel free to add more seasonings once cooked like fish sauce, 
            more soy sauce etc. The soup is very forgiving, you can get really 
            creative with your ingredients and flavors here.

            Cooking time given is based on my 1200W Panasonic Inverter 
            Microwave so your timing might vary. I suggest checking it after 
            1 minute and go from there.
