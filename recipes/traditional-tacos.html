   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>
      This is a delicious plate of traditional Mexican tacos. Being from Mexico,
      I tend to dislike American-style tacos, and have realized that not many
      Americans understand what Mexican tacos look and taste like. It's not easy
      to make Mexican tacos with American ingredients, but I've prepared a
      recipe the best I could. Enjoy!

   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            In a medium bowl, combine soy sauce, lime juice, 
            1 tablespoon canola oil, garlic, chili powder, 
            and oregano.
         </li>
         <li>
            In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, 
            combine soy sauce mixture and steak; marinate 
            for at least 1 hour up to 4 hours, turning the 
            bag occasionally.
         </li>
         <li>
            Heat remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large 
            skillet over medium high heat. Add steak and marinade, 
            and cook, stirring often, until steak has browned and 
            marinade has reduced, about 5-6 minutes, or until 
            desired doneness.
         </li>
         <li>
            Serve steak in tortillas, topped with onion, cilantro 
            and lime.
